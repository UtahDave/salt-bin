Salt Installer
==============

The Salt Installer project is here to allow for single binary builds of Salt
to be easy to make and distribute. Distributing Python applications is
nutoriously difficult, and while there are MANY tools that seek to solve
this problem, they can't do it in a universal way.

This project aims to combine multiple tools to build a single, portable
binary for salt.
